# AI-GenX
Excited to share my latest project AI-GenX! I built a chatbot using open-source large language models (LLMs) with Streamlit. This combination of powerful, flexible tools has allowed me to create an intelligent, responsive chatbot that enhances user interaction and provides valuable support.The process of integrating open-source LLMs with Streamlit has been an incredible learning experience. Streamlitâ€™s simplicity and effectiveness in deploying machine learning models made it an ideal choice for this project. By leveraging open-source tools, I was able to customize the chatbot to fit specific needs, ensuring a seamless and intuitive user experience.
